# tmcsets - Sales and Expense Tracker System

The **Sales and Expense Tracker System** is a simple and efficient tool designed to help users manage their sales and expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface for tracking income and expenditures, enabling better financial management. With this system, users can easily log, view, and analyze sales and expense data over time.

It is a personal project I developed for “The Mango Corner” restaurant as part of my Bachelor’s in Information Technology program. This system is designed to help the restaurant efficiently track and manage its sales, expenses, and profits. By allowing the user to input key financial data, such as daily sales and various expenses, the system is able to generate detailed reports, offering insights into financial performance over different timeframes—daily, monthly, and yearly. These reports help to visualize trends and support better decision-making in business operations.

As the sole developer of this project, I took full responsibility for its design, development, and implementation. The system provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input and update their sales and expense information. Through careful planning and coding, I ensured that the system is both functional and user-friendly, aiming to improve financial tracking and management for “The Mango Corner.” This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in programming, database management, and system design, providing me with valuable hands-on experience in building practical solutions for real-world business needs.
